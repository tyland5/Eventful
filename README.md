# Team Cinco's Project: Eventful
This project is a social media website that's meant to help people find events that are occuring in their area. This helps individuals if they want to do stuff with their friends or family, and can help organizations advertise whatever events they are hosting. Some features we support are filtering events, searching for events, and a unique leaderboard/badge system! The badge system works as follows: whenever a user attends an event, they can input an event code that the creator made (when they create an event post) and distributes. Our platform keeps track of the number and types of events user attends, and constantly updates the leaderboard. Below are some screenshots of our project

## Project structure
There are only a couple folders that are really altered on a consistent basis. 

Within the src folder are subfolders:

* Components- javascript code for the composition of webpages. There are also folders within this folder that help divide up different webpages like the feed, profile page, etc.

* Images- where all the pictures for things we would use for the website, like the logo, will go.

* Server- php files that communicate with the database

* Style- where all the css files for stylizing the web pages will go

Within the demo_apps are subfolders, each containing code for a demo app that's specified by the folder name

App.js and index.js is like any other project that is made with the npx create-react-app npm command
